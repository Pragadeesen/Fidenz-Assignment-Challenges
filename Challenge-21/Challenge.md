In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Build myStr from the strings "This is the start sentence. " and "This is the end sentence." using the + operator.


myStr should have a value of This is the start sentence. This is the end sentence.
Use the + operator to build myStr
myStr should be created using the var keyword.
Make sure to assign the result to the myStr variable.
