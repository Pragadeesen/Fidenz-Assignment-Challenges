Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:

if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";

Combine the two if statements into one statement which will return "Yes" if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return "No".


You should use the && operator once
You should only have one if statement
testLogicalAnd(0) should return "No"
testLogicalAnd(24) should return "No"
testLogicalAnd(25) should return "Yes"
testLogicalAnd(30) should return "Yes"
testLogicalAnd(50) should return "Yes"
testLogicalAnd(51) should return "No"
testLogicalAnd(75) should return "No"
testLogicalAnd(80) should return "No"
