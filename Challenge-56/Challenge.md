Challenges: Challenge - 56

If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.

if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}

Convert the logic to use else if statements.

You should have at least two else statements
You should have at least two if statements
testElseIf(0) should return "Smaller than 5"
testElseIf(5) should return "Between 5 and 20"
testElseIf(7) should return "Between 5 and 20"
testElseIf(10) should return "Between 5 and 20"
testElseIf(12) should return "Greater than 20"
