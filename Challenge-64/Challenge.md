ou may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Here's a sample object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.


Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.


myDog should contain the property name and it should be a string.
myDog should contain the property legs and it should be a number.
myDog should contain the property tails and it should be a number.
myDog should contain the property friends and it should be an array.
myDog should only contain all the given properties.
