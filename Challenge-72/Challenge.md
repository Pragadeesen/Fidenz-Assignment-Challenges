You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a "while loop", because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.


Push the numbers 6 through 10 to myArray using a while loop.


You should be using a while loop for this.
myArray should equal [6,7,8,9,10].
