In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].


Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

Hint
Try looking at the lastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.

lastLetterOfLastName should be "e".
You have to use .length to get the last letter.
