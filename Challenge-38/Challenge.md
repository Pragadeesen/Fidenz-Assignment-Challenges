pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.


Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray, assigning the "shifted off" value to removedFromMyArray.

myArray should now equal [["cat", 3]].
removedFromMyArray should contain ["John", 23].
