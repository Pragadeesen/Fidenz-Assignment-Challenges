The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

  2 < 5  // true
'3' < 7  // true
  5 < 5  // false
  3 < 2  // false
'8' < 4  // false

Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

testLessThan(0) should return "Under 25"
testLessThan(24) should return "Under 25"
testLessThan(25) should return "Under 55"
testLessThan(54) should return "Under 55"
testLessThan(55) should return "55 or Over"
testLessThan(99) should return "55 or Over"
You should use the < operator at least twice
