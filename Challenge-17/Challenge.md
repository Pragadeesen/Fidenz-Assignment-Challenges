Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;


Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

a should equal 5
b should equal -6
c should equal 1
You should use the -= operator for each variable
