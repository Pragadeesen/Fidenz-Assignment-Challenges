Challenges: Challenge - 23

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.


Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"


myName should be set to a string at least 3 characters long
Use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it
