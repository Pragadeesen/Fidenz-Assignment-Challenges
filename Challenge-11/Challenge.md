You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

Hint
Learn more about Arithmetic operators - Increment (++).

myVar should equal 68
myVar = myVar + 1; should be changed
Use the ++ operator
Do not change code above the line
