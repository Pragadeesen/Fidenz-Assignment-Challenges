You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

"Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.


Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.


lastNameLength should be equal to eight.
You should be getting the length of lastName by using .length like this: lastName.length.
