Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].


Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

Hint
Try looking at the firstLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.


The firstLetterOfLastName variable should have the value of B.
You should use bracket notation.
