There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using the dot operator (.) to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2

Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.


hatValue should be a string
The value of hatValue should be "ballcap"
shirtValue should be a string
The value of shirtValue should be "jersey"
You should use dot notation twice
