ou can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]


Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

Hint
Try looking at the thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.


secondToLastLetterOfLastName should be "c".
You have to use .length to get the second last letter.
