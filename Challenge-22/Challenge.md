We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: "This is the first sentence. " , "This is the second sentence." and " This is the third sentence." using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.


myStr should have a value of This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence. This is the third sentence.
Use the += operator to build myStr
