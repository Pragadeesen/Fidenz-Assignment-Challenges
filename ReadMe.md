Fidenz Assessment Instructions

Thank you for the interest in joining Fidenz Academy. Please read the following guidelines to complete the assessment, and to be shortlisted for the next step of the enrolment process. May the code be with you!

Please provide your mobile phone number and email address. These will be your unique identifications. We will contact you if you are selected for the next step.

There are 100 JavaScript challenges in the assessment.

These challenges are set to assess your core programming knowledge and critical thinking, which is key for a software developer.

If you are confident and thorough with JavaScript, please start from the 81st challenge. 

Successfully completing 10 challenges between 81st and the 100th will likely earn you a face-to-face interview.

There is no deadline set, but complete many questions as possible within the shortest possible time.

Anyone may apply to join the academy. The applicants would complete an aptitude test to be chosen as trainees. They do not set criteria for selection, but assess individualâ€™s interest and commitment for programming. They like if the participants have initiated developments on their own, may it be contributions to an open source project, or developing simple tools or utility to try out a programming language.
