With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

Hint
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.


myArray should be an array.
The first item in myArray should be a string.
The second item in myArray should be a number.
