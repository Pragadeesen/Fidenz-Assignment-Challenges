In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
This assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.


Assign the value 5 to variable a.

Assign the contents of a to variable b.

Do not change code above the line
a should have a value of 5
b should have a value of 5
a should be assigned to b with =
