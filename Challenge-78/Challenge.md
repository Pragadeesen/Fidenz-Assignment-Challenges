Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1

Note
Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.


Change randomFraction to return a random number instead of returning 0.


randomFraction should return a random number.
The number returned by randomFraction should be a decimal.
You should be using Math.random to generate the random decimal number.
