An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]

Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.

myArray should now equal [["John", 23], ["cat", 2], ["dog", 3]].
