We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0.

Example

var array = [50,60,70];
array[0]; // equals 50
var data = array[1];  // equals 60
Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.


Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

The variable myData should equal the first value of myArray.
The data in variable myArray should be accessed using bracket notation.
